💡 My current interests include:
- **Bayesian modelling**
- **Large language models (LLMs)**
- **Applied data science for development and humanitarian response**

🧠 I code primarily in **Python**, **R**, and **SQL**, with additional experience in **C++**, **JavaScript**, **Julia**, and **Mathematica**.
